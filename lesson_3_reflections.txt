q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
a: collaboration, switching computers

q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
a: maintain 2 different versions, especially if someone else is editing, or the changes haven't been finalized

q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
a: forks are clones, but on GitHub and inherently linking back to the original; clones do not have explicit reference; branches are connected, but do not duplicate the files; forks should be used when building upon someone else's project with credit given

q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
a: offline editing

q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
a: Google Drive spreadsheet to track updates; will not immediately allow for revisions

q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
a: always keep a working version, while still being able to experiment
